				<h2>What is Collaborative Art Title?</h2>
				<p>
					Sometimes, a great artist gets a stroke of inspiration and creates
					something beautiful. More often, a random group of people throws
					everything they have at a wall, hoping it sticks. You are a random person,
					and this is the wall. Will you make something great?
					That's for the others to decide.
				</p>
				<p>
					CAG is a 100*100 pixel canvas. When you log in, you can change a whopping
					10 pixels on the canvas. Alone that isn't much, but if you work together
					with your friends you can make impressive pieces of art!
				</p>
				<p>
					Once your 10 pixels are used up, you will get them back after an hour.
					So don't worry about making mistakes!
