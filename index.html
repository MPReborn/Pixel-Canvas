		<h2>What is Collaborative Art Title?</h2>
		<p>
			Sometimes, a great artist gets a stroke of inspiration and creates
			something beautiful. More often, a random group of people throws
			everything they have at a wall, hoping it sticks. You are a random person,
			and this is the wall. Will you make something great?
			That's for the others to decide.
		</p>
		<p>
			CAG is a 100*100 pixel canvas. When you log in, you can change a whopping
			10 pixels on the canvas. Alone that isn't much, but if you work together
			with your friends you can make impressive pieces of art!
		</p>
		<p>
			Once your 10 pixels are used up, you will get them back after an hour.
			So don't worry about making mistakes!
